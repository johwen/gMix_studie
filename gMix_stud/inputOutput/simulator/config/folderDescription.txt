This folder ("./inputOutput/simulator") contains input and output files required by 
the discrete-event network simulator included with the framework. The simulator 
config file is stored in "./inputOutput/config". It can be used to select the 
experiments to perform on the next run of the simulator. Experiments must be defined 
in config files in folder "./inputOutput/simulator/experimentDefinitions".
The folder "./inputOutput/simulator/plotscripts" contains the basic plot scripts 
used to visualize results. The plotscripts can be modified between the "# BEGIN 
modify" and "# END modify" tags (e.g. to select different pointsizes, scales, 
grids etc.). The simulator writes the results (plotscripts, recorded statistics as 
txt, config dump, graphs as eps) of each simulation run to 
"./inputOutput/simulator/output".
