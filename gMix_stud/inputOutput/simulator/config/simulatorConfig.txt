# the gMix Simulator requires several parameters to carry out an experiment. 
# These parameters must be specified in a single config file, the so-called 
# "experiment definition" file (EDF). EDFs must be placed in folder 
# ./inputOutput/simulator/experimentDefinitions/. Specify the name of the EDF,
# i.e., which experiment shall be performed when the simulator is run the next 
# time here:
# example: EXPERIMENTS_TO_PERFORM = exampleExperiment.txt
